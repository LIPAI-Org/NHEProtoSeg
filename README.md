# Investigation of normalization and segmentation techniques with interpretable features for H\&E histological images

Oral epithelial dysplasia is a precancerous condition identified through histological image analysis, typically performed by specialists. However, the high workload and variability in clinical expertise make this process subjective. Computational tools have been adopted as decision-support systems. 

This work investigates Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain normalization methods and develops a nucleus segmentation model based on a modified U-Net with feature interpretability. Dictionary learningâ€“based normalization techniques were evaluated using FSIM, PSNR, QSSIM, and SSIM.

# Investigation of normalization and segmentation techniques with interpretable features for H\&E histological images

Oral epithelial dysplasia is a precancerous condition identified through histological image analysis, typically performed by specialists. However, the high workload and variability in clinical expertise make this process subjective. Computational tools have been adopted as decision-support systems. This work investigates Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain normalization methods and develops a nucleus segmentation model based on a modified U-Net with feature interpretability. Dictionary learning–based normalization techniques were evaluated using FSIM, PSNR, QSSIM, and SSIM. The best performance was obtained with the Euclidean Distance–based method, achieving average values of 0.897, 44.401, 0.898, and 0.973 for the respective metrics. Segmentation improved with normalization, reaching Dice coefficients around 0.7683. However, combining normalization with the ProtoSeg interpretability strategy did not yield superior results. These findings indicate that H&E normalization positively impacts segmentation only when interpretability is not applied.
